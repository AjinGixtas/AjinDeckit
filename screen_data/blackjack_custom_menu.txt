[Stands/Hits] - Dealer Behavior on Soft 17
The dealer must [stop drawing cards/draw another card] if they have a hand totaling 17 that includes an Ace counted as 11 (a "soft" 17).

[ ] - Allow for Dealer to Peek for Blackjack
When the dealer’s upcard is an Ace or a 10-value card, the dealer checks their hole card to see if they have a Blackjack. This rule helps streamline the process and save time.

Note: This setting is disabled by default to make the game feel more "fair." Enabling or disabling this option does not affect the game's overall outcome; it is only intended to clarify how the game handles potential Blackjacks and might help avoid confusion for players unfamiliar with how the computer’s RNG works.
