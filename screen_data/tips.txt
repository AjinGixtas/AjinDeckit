Probability mathematician's tips of the day:
(1) The House Always Wins: The odds are rigged in favor of the casino. Over time, the house is 
                           guaranteed to profit—not you.
(2) Get a hobby: Burning cash isn’t entertainment. Read a book, get a dog, buy some cool toys or learn 
something new. If you think throwing your money for fun makes you a rich genius then you're an idiot.
(3) No Such Thing as "Near-Misses": You win it all or you lose everything, there's no consolation prize.
Your decision barely influence the outcome. Thinking you can outsmart the game is just arrogance.
