BWAHHHH!!! EVERYONE (*one)! I'M BACK! :D

I didn't do a whole lot recently, the competitive programming stuff is exhausting and useless. Not fun and useful at all X(

It's genuinely shocking how little thing've changed. I finally got on the Rust hype train (3 years late). Expand some cybersecurity stuff, and FINALLY made a neural network from scratch.
That shit was 3 years in the making and godamn it's awful.

Anyway, there's that for y'all (*one). Have fun! If this thing were to become popular and clowned on the internet, I would be more than happy to let it happens...                                                        PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN I BEG YOU ToT
Also, I got IELTS 8 now, which mean, I (*can, *if I have the money, *and academic record) go to other countries :D THAT'S SO AWESOME :D I AM SO HAPPY (*if I were to be able to move)












































































































































































































































































































































































i just want to leave this place. there's too many failure in everything. no friend, no money, no talent, i adopted philosophy and ideology to ignore the shame and dissapointment, but it would be great if i can just leave this place. nothing remotely related to the human condition is good in me, maybe, [just maybe] if i go to another country, slave there long enough, they will let me leech off their welfare program, while i work in a dead-end 9-to-5 job. everyone i want to be is so beyond and away from me, befriending them is impossible (that sounds exploitative, but it's not like it has gone any better for people around or under my level anyway), now intruding and monitoring them is the only way. maybe this was kind of intended. born and lived in a mountain, now living in the outskirt, with a laptop on one hand and a military goggle dad bought in another hopefully i will find a job related to it. else, it will be for naught.

Anyway! That's was dissapointing, maybe let's not think about it too hard. SAD is slowly creeping in now. I like to think of these factor as like attacker, slowly attacking and chipping away at my coping defense lines. If they reach the core, I lose (probably with suicide or something close to it), so let's hope it's not gonna happen. Failure for containment (like above) is kind of expected, and is the threat from the inside, trying to meet with the attacker. Now that I think about it, its probably better think of as a hostile entity requiring containment (*gasp* SCP? :o). Will this ever change? Unlikely, it's usually gonna get worse before it gets better. Most people don't, and the few that do actually just fall back down again. Doing art, tech, philosophy and political thinking are basically a value bundle for lifelong depression and psychological issue. So should I stop? NEIN! I'm bored, and sad :(, and this is fun (sometime), so we'll go with that.













(*gap* did you notice it? It's the ouroboros of the eccentric creature's bullshit logic, who so pride themselves in being rational and holding Enlightenment value! "I'm sad"->"Do art"->"Get sad"->Repeat!. BWAHHHH!!! THEY ARE TRULY FASCINATING!!!)


(Oh yeah, can anyone do a research on successful romantic approach for people are. I failed like 6 already and we're not even in the big 30 yet ;-;



























I would love to be a part of a technocratic oligarchy one day! Oh well, a man can dream ;-;
